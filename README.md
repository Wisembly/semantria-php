# semantria-php

PHP SDK for Semantria API (http://semantria.com).

This SDK is NOT official, heavily inspired by [intercom-php](https://github.com/intercom/intercom-php)
and by [official Semantria PHP SDK](https://semantria.com/support/developer/docs/sdks)

We developped and maintain this library for our own usage and released it open
source (see LICENCE.md) if it could help.
Semantria and its API belongs to Semantria.
